BC Campaign Editor
by USS Sovereign (BCS-TNG)
==========================

What's this program about?
This program rewrites specified Single Player scripts to allow users to replace default Galaxy and Sovereign bridges and ships within the campaign scripts. 
The program should work with any Single Player variant (i.e. Stock Campaign, Forgotten Dialogue mod). 

How does it work?
It writes 4 variables in Maelstrom.py which holds the information regarding the replacements and scripts which hold the hardcoded information are rewritten to account for these changes.

What this program doesn't do?
It will not add Phased Torpedoes to your Sovereign replacement for example and it will not compensate for replacement bridge issues.

How do I use it?
1. Make sure to have DotNet 4.0 installed
2. Run the program
3. Specify Replacements you wish to use
4. Click on Rewrite SP Scripts
5. Navigate to Maelstrom folder and press okay
6. Wait a few seconds for the rewrite to complete

Program is not rewriting the SP Scripts!
There could be 2 reasons for this:
1. You didn't point the program towards the root Maelstrom folder
2. You're trying to rewrite already rewritten scripts which the program can't do

Any special instructions?
Always backup SP Scripts before using this program.
